- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/node`
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Code follows the semistandard style (Standard + semicolons) and AirBnB style
- All files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
- `var` keyword is not allowed

## Tasks

### 0. Rectangle #0

- Objective: Write an empty class Rectangle that defines a rectangle using the class notation.

### 1. Rectangle #1

- Objective: Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle, initializing width and height using a constructor.

### 2. Rectangle #2

- Objective: Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle, initializing width and height and handling edge cases.

### 3. Rectangle #3

- Objective: Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle, initializing width and height, handling edge cases, and creating a method to print the rectangle using character X.

### 4. Rectangle #4

- Objective: Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle, initializing width and height, handling edge cases, and creating methods to print, rotate, and double the rectangle.

### 5. Square #0

- Objective: Write a class Square that defines a square and inherits from Rectangle, initializing size and calling the Rectangle constructor.

### 6. Square #1

- Objective: Write a class Square that defines a square, inherits from Square, and creates a method to print the square using a specific character.

### 7. Occurrences

- Objective: Write a function that returns the number of occurrences in a list.

### 8. Esrever

- Objective: Write a function that returns the reversed version of a list without using the built-in method reverse.

### 9. Log me

- Objective: Write a function that prints the number of arguments already printed and the new argument value.

### 10. Number conversion

- Objective: Write a function that converts a number from base 10 to another base passed as an argument.

### 11. Factor index (Advanced)

- Objective: Write a script that computes a new array based on a given array.

### 12. Sorted occurrences (Advanced)

- Objective: Write a script that computes a dictionary of user ids by occurrence.

### 13. Concat files (Advanced)

- Objective: Write a script that concatenates two files into a destination file.
