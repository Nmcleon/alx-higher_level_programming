# 0x0F-python-object_relational_mapping
(NB: advanced tasks not completed)

This project covers object-relational mapping (ORM) in Python using the SQLAlchemy library to interact with databases.

## Tasks

### 0. Get all states
* Write a script that lists all `State` objects from the database `hbtn_0e_6_usa`. 

### 1. Filter states
* Write a script that lists all `State` objects that contain the letter 'a' from the database `hbtn_0e_6_usa`.

### 2. Filter states by user input
* Write a script that takes in an argument and displays all values in the `states` table where `name` matches the argument.

### 3. SQL Injection...
* Write a script that takes in arguments and displays all values in the `states` table where `name` matches the argument. 

### 4. Cities by states
* Write a script that lists all `City` objects from the database `hbtn_0e_101_usa`.

### 5. All cities by state
* Write a script that takes in the name of a state as an argument and lists all `City` objects in that state.

### 6. First state model
* Define a class `State` that inherits from `Base` and links to the MySQL table `states`.

### 7. All states via SQLAlchemy
* Write a script that lists all `State` objects from the database using SQLAlchemy.

### 8. First state
* Write a script that prints the first `State` object from the database using SQLAlchemy.

### 9. Contains `a`
* Write a script that lists all `State` objects that contain the letter 'a' using SQLAlchemy.

### 10. Get a state
* Write a script that prints the `State` object with the name passed as argument using SQLAlchemy.

### 11. Add a new state
* Write a script that adds the `State` object “Louisiana” to the database using SQLAlchemy.

### 12. Update a state
* Write a script that changes the name of a `State` object from the database using SQLAlchemy.

### 13. Delete states
* Write a script that deletes all `State` objects with name containing the letter 'a' from the database using SQLAlchemy.
